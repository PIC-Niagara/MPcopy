To use the python aspect of this code, you should set environment variable PYTHONPATH
to include both the top level directories of the MAVProxy code, and the mavlink code.
For example, here is the command under macos to print the PYTHONPATH:
printenv PYTHONPATH
/Users/phollands/Desktop/development/MatrixPilot_wjp_helicalTurns/Tools/MAVLink/MAVProxy:/Users/phollands/Desktop/development/MatrixPilot_wjp_helicalTurns/Tools/MAVLink/mavlink
